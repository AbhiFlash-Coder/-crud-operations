I have performed some crud operations using spring boot via Postman to Mysql.
Here spring boot is a framework and postman is a API and Mysql is a database workbench.
Firstly I have craeted a spring initializer and add some dependencies used fot the crud operations like Spring Web,Spring Data Jpa,Mysql driver and Spring DevTools.
After that I have successfully created a spring boot project file which is ready to perform CRUD Operations.
Then started to perform CRUD operations.
